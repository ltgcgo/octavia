* Developed with Firefox and an open Web in mind.
<!--* [Less than 20 kilobytes when compressed](docs/support/compress.md).-->
* Supports 8 ports, 128 channels, 512-voice polyphony maximum. More than you'll ever need.
* Built-in support of several standards, multiple plug-in cards, and tons of devices.
* Tells when MIDI programming errors are spotted, reducing chances of faulty programming.
* Available in JS (browser and Deno) and Rust (not yet).
* No modification required to run in Tor Browser, Bromite and LibreWolf.
* Wide support of bank mapping and bitmaps via [`midi-db`](https://github.com/ltgcgo/midi-db).
